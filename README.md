This project deals with understanding the relationships between a select group of statistics and winning in the MLB.

The statistics are each from one of three categories: batting, pitching, or fielding.

Python, along with a host of libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), was used to process the data and carry out the analysis.

This repository contains code, datasets, pictures and the final report for this project.

Welcome!
